Nurse Management App Overview:


The Nurse Management App is a web-based application that empowers nurses to create and manage their own schedules efficiently.
This app is designed to streamline the scheduling process, allowing nurses to have more control over their work hours and providing administrators with a 
centralized platform for both managing the nurses and shift management.
